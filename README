Inbreeding Calulator
by Sam Kauffman

The Inbreeding Calculator is a standalone single-page web application
consisting of the files index.html, inbreeding.js, and style.css. There is also
another page, about.html, which contains an article about inbreeding,
instructions for using the Inbreeding Calculator, sample pedigrees, and
recommended reading. That page is not released under the GPL, but the
instructions are also available in the file instructions.html, which is
released under the GPL.

The Inbreeding Calculator and its documentation were created and are maintained
by Sam Kauffman of Zika Hamstery <zikahamstery.weebly.com>. It is released
under the terms of the GNU General Public License, EXCEPT for the files
about.html and about.js, which are licensed under a Creative Commons
